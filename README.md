164 Price Ranges

Description

Quiz description by James Edward Gray II

You have a list of price ranges from different vendors like:

Company A:  $1,000 - $3,000
Company B:  $6,000 - $10,000
Company C:  $500 - $2,500
Given such a list and the desired price range a shopper wishes to pay, return the companies the shopper should examine. For example, if the shopperâ€™s price range was:

Low:   $2,500
High:  $5,000
the companies returned would be:

Company A
Company C
The shopper should also be allowed to provide just a low or just a high value instead of both, should they prefer to do so.
